# Marching Squares Algorithm with OpenCV

This Python project utilizes mathematical functions to create data and applies the marching squares algorithm to determine contours. The visual results are rendered with OpenCV.

## Key Features:

- Utilization of the marching squares algorithm to detect contours in a data grid.
- Experimentation with various mathematical functions to generate diverse patterns.
- Use of the PIL library for image creation and OpenCV for drawing contours.
- Easy execution on Google Colab or locally.

## Included Examples of Mathematical Functions:

- \( F(x, y) = \sin(x) \cdot \cos(y) \) for periodic variation.
- \( F(x, y) = e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{1000.0}} \) for Gaussian decay.
- \( F(x, y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) for radial gradient.
- \( F(x, y) = \cos(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) \) for cosine rings.
- \( F(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 500 \) for a polynomial function.

## How to Use:

1. Run the code on Google Colab or locally.
2. Experiment with different mathematical functions and thresholds to obtain unique results.
3. Visualize the generated patterns directly with OpenCV.
